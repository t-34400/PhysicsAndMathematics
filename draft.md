- Q. The platinum-irridium prototype kilogram is a right cylinder with dimensions chosen to minimize the surface area given fixed volume $V$ (which is determined by its density). Based on this information, (i) determine the radius of the prototype kilogram and (ii) the ratio of the radius to the height.
- A. The volume for a cylinder of redius $r$ and height $h$ is given by
  $$V=\pi r^2 h$$
  and the surface of it is given by
  $$S=2\pi r^2+2\pi r h = 2\pi r^2 + \frac{2V}{r}$$
  Minimize the surface area with respect to the radius by setting
  $$0=\frac{d S}{d r} = 4 \pi r - \frac{2V}{r^2}$$
  which we can easily solve for the radius:
  $$r=\sqrt[3]{\frac{V}{2\pi}}$$
  Because we also know that $V=\pi r^2 h$, we can rewrite the equation as
  $$2\pi r^3 = \pi r^2 h$$
  which implies that ratio of the radius to the height is 
  $$\frac{r}{h}=\frac{1}{2}$$
